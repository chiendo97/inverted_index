# inverted_index

A C++ implementation of Reversed-index search engine and BM25 ranking function.

# Implementation

In each implementation, there are 3 main modules to process: input, preprocessing_document and query function.

- input function: read from product_names.txt into `vector<string> strs`
- preprocessing_document function: from `vector<string> strs`, prepare data struct for quering.
- query function: from data stucture created in preprocessing_document function, query is preformed.

In each algorithm, I used different data structures to perform quering.

## Reversed-index

A [Trie](https://vnoi.info/wiki/algo/data-structures/trie), also called digital tree, radix tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

In each node, there are 2 variables:

```
set<int> v_set; // contain every docid of document which contain keyword
unordered_map<char, Trie*> map; // contain pointers to next node of a Trie tree
```

## BM25 ranking function

I only used standard data structures of C++, which are: map, set and vector. They are used in order to create 2 classes with different purposes:

- InvertedIndex: // similar to Reversed-index

  - `map<string, set<int>> nq; // a keyword mapping to a set contain every docid of document which contain this keyword`
  - `map<string, map<int, int>> fq; // a keyword mapping to another map for every docid of document with how many time this keyword appear in this document`

- DocumentLengthTable: // manager the length of each document which is how many words there are and the avg length of all documents.

# How To Run

Inside the code, there are 2 functions:

- custom_test(): custom query input from console
- test_with_100_query(): read query from the file `100_query.txt` and run query into file `100_query_result.txt`

Code default is custom_test()

You can modify the code into test_with_100_query() for runing with 100_query.txt test.

## Reversed-index

```
cd reversed_index/
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main && ./main product_names.txt
```

## BM25 ranking function

```
cd BM25/
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main && ./main product_names.txt
```

# Evaluation

The estimate time of preprocessing_document function is 3-6s.

### Reversed-index

Each query last 1-2s to perform

Result doesn't estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query

### BM25 ranking function

Each query lasts 10-60s depends on how many words there are in keyword

Result estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query
